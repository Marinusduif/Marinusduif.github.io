				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>
					Hello my name is Marinus I’m 19 years old and live in Heerjansdam. I’m a technical artist with that I mean that I make visual effects in Unity by using post-processing, shader grafting, lighting, and more. The types of games I like to make are virtual museums, so games like Monuments of Grief and KID A MNESIA EXHIBITION.
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I make music with my band de Bovendanen. We make Dutch art-punk with not too serious topics. I also use my experience with music to make soundtracks for my games. I also write short monologs and stories for a book I’m working on. I’m also an actor; I mainly play very big and physical roles. I also sometimes write for these plays. I’ve played in the New Luxor Theater, which is the biggest theatre in Rotterdam. I’m someone with a lot of hobbies; I mainly like making art. I also see all the games I make as works of art. It’s my dream to have one of my games in a modern art museum, not just as an informational game but as a real work of art. Because that’s what I think games are: artworks. That’s why I like virtual museums so much; because that’s one of the greatest ways to combine a game with a museum and art.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also really like real motion games, because that’s a medium where I can combine all of my interests and talents. It’s a game but also a movie. But when working on games, I like to do a bit of everything because doing one thing the whole time bores me. But when needed, I can always do what needs to be done.
